To whom it may concern,

This is my first post in this Blog page, which I may or may not continue to update.

My initial thought is to just blab about things that makes me curious, maybe complain a bit about some issues. It might look a bit like a newsletter, but with no news, and it's not a letter.

In any case, if you would like to know more about bioinformatics, I might also right some tutorials. Again, let's keep the expectations where they belong.

Thank you for joining me on this exciting adventure.

Jay :D
