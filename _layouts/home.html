        <br>I am a Biologist, interested in all manners of science. During my undergrad days I worked in laboratories of paleontology, wastewater treatment, biodivesity and settled down with genetics and molecular biology.<br>
        I earned a master's degree in Biociences and Biotechnology at ICC/Fiocruz, exploring genes under positive selective pressure in Trypanosoma cruzi under the guidance of Dr. Christian Probst.<br>
        During my time at Fiocruz, I also was the coordinator for the development of an electronic game project, funded by the Vice-Presidency of Education, Information, and Communication (VPEIC). Following my master's, I collaborated with Dr. Letusa Albrecht, focusing on epitope prediction and genetic aspects of Plasmodium vivax.<br>
        Embarking on a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Synthetic Biology and Biomimetics Laboratory (Synbiom), led by Prof. Dr. Liza Felicori. My research delves into immunosenescence and its impact, particularly examining antibody repertoires in the context of COVID-19. Additionally, I am a member of the IdeaReal laboratory, a multidisciplinary open lab at UFMG, actively promoting synthetic biology knowledge and increasing awareness of the biohacking or do-it-yourself biology (DIYBio) movement.<br>
